    <h2>Codewar--Unique values in an array (by difference)</h2>

    <h3>//Instructions

        // Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and
        returns the result.

        // It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

        // array_diff([1, 2], [1]) == [2]

        // If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

        // array_diff([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2]) == [1, 3]

        ==> Look at the console for results</h3>
